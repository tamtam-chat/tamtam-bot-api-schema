    # About
    Bot API allows bots to interact with TamTam. Methods are called by sending HTTPS requests to [botapi.tamtam.chat](https://botapi.tamtam.chat) domain.
    Bots are third-party applications that use TamTam features. A bot can legitimately take part in a conversation. It can be achieved through HTTP requests to the TamTam Bot API.

    ## Features
    TamTam bots of the current version are able to:
    - Communicate with users and respond to requests
    - Recommend users complete actions via programmed buttons
    - Request personal data from users (name, short reference, phone number)
    We'll keep working on expanding bot capabilities in the future.

    ## Examples
    Bots can be used for the following purposes:
    - Providing support, answering frequently asked questions
    - Sending typical information
    - Voting
    - Likes/dislikes
    - Following external links
    - Forwarding a user to a chat/channel

    ## @PrimeBot
    [PrimeBot](https://tt.me/primebot) is the main bot in TamTam, all bots creator. Use PrimeBot to create and edit
    your bots. Feel free to contact us for any questions, [@support](https://tt.me/support) or [team@tamtam.chat](mailto:team@tamtam.chat).

    ## HTTP verbs
    `GET` &mdash; getting resources, parameters are transmitted via URL

    `POST` &mdash; creation of resources (for example, sending new messages)

    `PUT` &mdash; editing resources

    `DELETE` &mdash; deleting resources

    `PATCH` &mdash; patching resources

    ## HTTP response codes
    `200` &mdash; successful operation

    `400` &mdash; invalid request

    `401` &mdash; authentication error

    `404` &mdash; resource not found

    `405` &mdash; method is not allowed

    `429` &mdash; the number of requests is exceeded

    `503` &mdash; service unavailable

    ## Resources format
    For content requests (PUT and POST) and responses, the API uses the JSON format.
    All strings are UTF-8 encoded.
    Date/time fields are represented as the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since 00:00 January 1, 1970 in the long format. To get it, you can simply multiply the UNIX timestamp by 1000. All date/time fields have a UTC timezone.
    ## Error responses
    In case of an error, the API returns a response with the corresponding HTTP code and JSON with the following fields:

    `code` - the string with the error key

    `message` - a string describing the error </br>

    For example:
    ```bash
    > http https://botapi.tamtam.chat/chats?access_token={EXAMPLE_TOKEN}
    HTTP / 1.1 403 Forbidden
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Content-Length: 57
    Content-Type: application / json; charset = utf-8
    Set-Cookie: web_ui_lang = ru; Path = /; Domain = .tamtam.chat; Expires = 2019-03-24T11: 45: 36.500Z
    {
       "code": "verify.token",
       "message": "Invalid access_token"
    }
    ```
    ## Receiving notifications
    TamTam Bot API supports 2 options of receiving notifications on new events for bots:
    - Push notifications via WebHook. To receive data via WebHook, you'll have to [add subscription](https://dev.tamtam.chat/#operation/subscribe);
    - Notifications upon request via [long polling](#operation/getUpdates) API. All data can be received via long polling **by default** after creating the bot.

    Both methods **cannot** be used simultaneously.
    Refer to the response schema of [/updates](https://dev.tamtam.chat/#operation/getUpdates) method to check all available types of updates.

    ### Webhook
    There is some notes about how we handle webhook subscription:
    - Sometimes webhook notification cannot be delivered in case when bot server or network is down.

      In such case we will retry delivery in a short period of time (from 30 to 60 seconds) and will do this until get
      `200 OK` status code from your server, but not longer than **8 hours** (*may change over time*) since update happened.
      Subscription can be cancelled if bot doesn't response to webhook notification.

      We also consider any non `200` response from server as failed delivery.

    - To protect your bot from unexpected high load we send **no more than 100** notifications per second by default.
      If you want increase this limit, contact us at [@support](https://tt.me/support).


    It should be from one of the following subnets:
    ```
    185.16.150.0/30
    185.16.150.84/30
    185.16.150.152/30
    185.16.150.192/30
    ```


    ## Message buttons
    You can program buttons for users answering a bot.
    TamTam supports the following types of buttons:

    `callback` &mdash; sends a notification with payload to a bot (via WebHook or long polling)

    `link` &mdash; makes a user to follow a link

    `request_contact` &mdash; requests the user permission to access contact information (phone number, short link, email)

    `request_geo_location` &mdash; asks user to provide current geo location

    `chat` &mdash; creates chat associated with message

    To start create buttons [send message](#operation/sendMessage) with `InlineKeyboardAttachment`:
    ```json
    {
      "text": "It is message with inline keyboard",
      "attachments": [
        {
          "type": "inline_keyboard",
          "payload": {
            "buttons": [
              [
                {
                  "type": "callback",
                  "text": "Press me!",
                  "payload": "button1 pressed"
                }
              ],
              [
                {
                  "type": "chat",
                  "text": "Discuss",
                  "chat_title": "Message discussion"
                }
              ]
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    ### Chat button
    Chat button is a button that starts chat assosiated with the current message. It will be **private** chat with a link, bot will be added as administrator by default.

    Chat will be created as soon as the first user taps on button. Bot will receive `message_chat_created` update.

    Bot can set title and description of new chat by setting `chat_title` and `chat_description` properties.

    Whereas keyboard can contain several `chat` buttons there is `uuid` property to distinct them between each other.
    In case you do not pass `uuid` we will generate it. If you edit message, pass `uuid` so we know that this button starts the same chat as before.

    Chat button also can contain `start_payload` that will be sent to bot as part of `message_chat_created` update.

    ## Deep linking
    TamTam supports deep linking mechanism for bots. It allows passing additional payload to the bot on startup.
    Deep link can contain any data encoded into string up to **128** characters long. Longer strings will be omitted and **not** passed to the bot.

    Each bot has start link that looks like:
    ```
    https://tt.me/%BOT_USERNAME%/start/%PAYLOAD%
    ```
    As soon as user clicks on such link we open dialog with bot and send this payload to bot as part of `bot_started` update:
    ```json
    {
        "update_type": "bot_started",
        "timestamp": 1573226679188,
        "chat_id": 1234567890,
        "user": {
            "user_id": 1234567890,
            "name": "Boris",
            "username": "borisd84"
        },
        "payload": "any data meaningful to bot"
    }
    ```

    Deep linking mechanism is supported for iOS version 2.7.0 and Android 2.9.0 and higher.

    ## Constructors
    Constructor is a bot that can create a message for user: add buttons, attach some media, insert text.

    You can enable constructor mode for your bot via [@PrimeBot](https://tt.me/primebot)
    sending [/constructor_mode](https://tt.me/primebot/start/constructor_mode) command.

    For bot developers, it looks like request-response interaction where TamTam application
    sends `message_construction_request` on behalf of user. Bot [responds](#operation/construct)
    to it with `messages` ready to go or `keyboard` in case it requires further action from user.

    Bot also can set up UI parts such as `hint` or `placeholder`, allow or not user's input:
    ![Constructor UI parts](https://dev.tamtam.chat/static/hint-079a332a51a2e9e6d415ec716389661b.png)

    As soon as user finishes composing a message, they can post it. Bot will receive `message_constructed_update`
    with posted message.

    Constructors are supported for iOS version 2.7.0 and Android 2.9.0 and higher.

    ## Text formatting

    Message text can be improved with basic formatting such as: **strong**, *emphasis*, ~strikethough~,
    <ins>underline</ins>, `code` or link. You can use either markdown-like or HTML formatting.

    To enable text formatting set the `format` property of [NewMessageBody](#tag/new_message_model).

    ### TamTam flavored Markdown
    To enable [Markdown](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/) parsing, set the `format` property of [NewMessageBody](#tag/new_message_model) to `markdown`.

    We currently support only the following syntax:

    `*empasized*` or `_empasized_` for *italic* text

    `**strong**` or `__strong__` for __bold__ text

    `~~strikethough~~`  for ~strikethough~ text

    `++underline++`  for <ins>underlined</ins> text

    ``` `code` ``` for inline `monospaced` text (line endings inside this block are treated like spaces)

    ` ```code``` ` for `monospaced` text block

    `^^important^^` for highlighted text (colored in red, by default)

    `[Inline URL](https://dev.tamtam.chat/)` for inline URLs

    `[User mention](tamtam://user/%user_id%)` for user mentions without username

    `# Header` for header

    ### HTML support

    To enable HTML parsing, set the `format` property of [NewMessageBody](#tag/new_message_model) to `html`.

    Only the following HTML tags are supported. All others will be stripped:

    Emphasized: `<i>` or `<em>`

    Strong: `<b>` or `<strong>`

    Strikethrough: `<del>` or `<s>`

    Underlined: `<ins>` or `<u>`

    Link: `<a href="https://dev.tamtam.chat">Docs</a>`

    Monospaced text: `<pre>` or `<code>`

    Highlighted text: `<mark>`

    Header: `<h1>`

    Text formatting is supported for iOS since version 3.1 and Android since 2.20.0.

    # Versioning
    API models and interface may change over time. To make sure your bot will get the right info, we strongly recommend adding API version number to each request. You can add it as `v` parameter to each HTTP-request. For instance, `v=0.1.2`.
    To specify the data model version you are getting through WebHook subscription, use the `version` property in the request body of the [subscribe](https://dev.tamtam.chat/#operation/subscribe) request.

      description: |-
        Returns the URL for the subsequent file upload.

        For example, you can upload it via curl:

        ```curl -i -X POST
          -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
          -F "data=@movie.mp4" "%UPLOAD_URL%"```

        Two types of an upload are supported:
        - single request upload (multipart request)
        - and resumable upload.

        ##### Multipart upload
        This type of upload is a simpler one but it is less
        reliable and agile. If a `Content-Type`: multipart/form-data header is passed in a request our service indicates
        upload type as a simple single request upload.

        This type of an upload has some restrictions:

        - Max. file size - 2 Gb
        - Only one file per request can be uploaded
        - No possibility to restart stopped / failed upload

        ##### Resumable upload
        If `Content-Type` header value is not equal to `multipart/form-data` our service indicated upload type
        as a resumable upload.
        With a `Content-Range` header current file chunk range and complete file size
        can be passed. If a network error has happened or upload was stopped you can continue to upload a file from
        the last successfully uploaded file chunk. You can request the last known byte of uploaded file from server
        and continue to upload a file.

        ##### Get upload status
        To GET an upload status you simply need to perform HTTP-GET request to a file upload URL.
        Our service will respond with current upload status,
        complete file size and last known uploaded byte. This data can be used to complete stopped upload
        if something went wrong. If `REQUESTED_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE` or `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` status was returned
        it is a good point to try to restart an upload

        Sends a message to a chat.
        As a result for this method new message identifier returns.
        ### Attaching media
        Attaching media to messages is a three-step process.

        At first step, you should [obtain a URL to upload](#operation/getUploadUrl) your media files.

        At the second, you should upload binary of appropriate format to URL you obtained at the previous step. See [upload](https://dev.tamtam.chat/#operation/getUploadUrl) section for details.

        Finally, if the upload process was successful, you will receive JSON-object in a response body.  Use this object to create attachment. Construct an object with two properties:
        - `type` with the value set to appropriate media type
        - and `payload` filled with the JSON you've got.

        For example, you can attach a video to message this way:

        1. Get URL to upload. Execute following:
        ```shell
        curl -X POST 'https://botapi.tamtam.chat/uploads?access_token=%access_token%&type=video'
        ```
        As the result it will return URL for the next step.
        ```json
        {
            "url": "https://vu.mycdn.me/upload.do…"
        }
        ```

        2. Use this url to upload your binary:
        ```shell
        curl -i -X POST
          -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
          -F "data=@movie.mp4" "https://vu.mycdn.me/upload.do…"
        ```
        As the result it will return JSON you can attach to message:
        ```json
          {
            "token": "_3Rarhcf1PtlMXy8jpgie8Ai_KARnVFYNQTtmIRWNh4"
          }
        ```
        3. Send message with attach:
        ```json
        {
            "text": "Message with video",
            "attachments": [
                {
                    "type": "video",
                    "payload": {
                        "token": "_3Rarhcf1PtlMXy8jpgie8Ai_KARnVFYNQTtmIRWNh4"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        **Important notice**:

        It may take time for the server to process your file (audio/video or any binary).
        While a file is not processed you can't attach it. It means the last step will fail with `400` error.
        Try to send a message again until you'll get a successful result.

        You can use this method for getting updates in case your bot is not subscribed to WebHook. The method is based on long polling.

        Every update has its own sequence number. `marker` property in response points to the next upcoming update.

        All previous updates are considered as *committed* after passing `marker` parameter.
        If `marker` parameter is **not passed**, your bot will get all updates happened after the last commitment.
